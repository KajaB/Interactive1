      &nbsp On Market Street in downtown San Francisco, an old man with long, dirty hair has dropped his collection can. Coins and scraps of paper spill across the sidewalk and into the road. Nobody is helping. <br></br>
&nbsp Every day, between two and four in the morning, cleaners with high-powered water jets come out to hose Market Street clean of urine, rubbish and, sometimes, men, women and children who have nowhere else to go. Bags and belongings are confiscated in an effort to discourage one of America's most intransigent homeless populations from sleeping on sidewalks that are now slap in the centre of the most desirable neighbourhood in one of the nation's most expensive cities. This is where Twitter has its headquarters. This is where the best and brightest young minds in the world come to work as engineers, designers, visionaries. It's just a shame that the smell of shit and guilty consciences is hard to soak away.

      &nbsp The story of how the hi-tech industry has brought rapid social change to San Francisco has been written before, by journalists and authors who have lived their entire lives in the Bay Area and watched the city struggle through successive industrial bubbles and survive. That story has been so well covered in recent months that the San Francisco Chronicle published a short guide "to help our brethren who have flocked here to write the latest 'How the tech boom is changing San Francisco' opus": "It is a tale of two cities. It's a city of very rich people and very poor people... A city losing its soul. Sleek, black Uber cars that whisk hipsters from bar to bar... Thirteen-dollar sandwiches. Google Glass. That's your opening paragraph, visiting journalists. You're welcome."
